# Lane Follower based on Nav2

This project is an exploration into advanced robotics navigation, specifically focusing on utilizing the Navigation2 (Nav2) stack to enable a robot to navigate using a specific lane. Our goal is to push the boundaries of autonomous navigation within structured environments.

## Acknowledgments

Before diving into the details of our project, we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to Steve Macenski. Steve's contributions to the field of robotics, particularly his work on the SLAM Toolbox for ROS 2, have been invaluable to our project. His dedication to open-source robotics has not only propelled the field forward but has also directly influenced our approach to solving complex navigation challenges.
